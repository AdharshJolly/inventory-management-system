# Product Guidelines

## Voice and Tone
- **Professional and Direct:** The application's UI and documentation should prioritize efficiency and clarity.
- **Concise & Jargon-Free:** Use language that is easy to understand in a fast-paced environment, avoiding unnecessary complexity.
- **Action-Oriented:** Focus on guiding users through tasks (e.g., "Add Stock", "Update Supplier") with clear, active verbs.

## Visual Identity
- **Professional and Clean Aesthetic:** A neutral color palette (whites, grays, and deep blues) provides a stable, enterprise-grade feel.
- **Strategic Use of Color:** Employ bold accent colors exclusively for primary actions or critical alerts to draw immediate attention.
- **Structured Layouts:** Use a clear, grid-based system to ensure information is organized and easy to navigate.

## User Experience Standards
- **Contextual Feedback:**
    - Use unobtrusive toasts/snackbars for routine successes (e.g., "Product saved").
    - Reserve prominent banners for critical errors or urgent system alerts.
- **Visual Status Indicators:**
    - Use color-coded badges (e.g., green for 'In Stock', red for 'Low Stock') for instant data recognition.
    - Implement progress bars where appropriate to show stock levels relative to capacity.
- **Information Scaffolding:**
    - Maintain a consistent visual hierarchy with headings and bullet points.
    - Ensure layouts are predictable across different modules to reduce user cognitive load.
